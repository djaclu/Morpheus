Instructions:

You’re going to set the phone flat in bed near your hand and place it horizontally, so your index finger matches the side marked lower and your middle finger the side marked higher.

Before you start send me a screenshot of the web app so that I know that it’s working, also connect your wireless earphones and click anywhere on the screen, some ambient music should start, if you can hear it everything is working, refresh the page to reset.

Then I want you to wear an eye mask and some earphones when you’re ready to sleep, in PJs teeth brushed etc.

Then you can click on the screen to start. You’re going hear two tones.

If the second tone has a higher pitch than the first then use your middle finger to click on “higher” on the right sides If the second tone is lower than the first then use your index finger to click on “lower” on the left side.

If you’re correct you’ll hear a high-pitch bell confirming. If you’re wrong you’ll hear a low-pitch bell confirming.

A typical person takes 15-20 minutes to fall asleep—I’ve made the app twice as long at 40 minutes to account for you.

At 20 minutes the game will be half as loud and at 40 minutes the game should go silent.
