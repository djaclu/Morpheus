Instructions:

When you are ready to start place your phone in Sleep Mode, lower the brightness and then navigate to the home page.

Connect your wireless earphones and click anywhere on the screen, some ambient music should start. You’re going hear two tones.

If the second tone has a higher pitch than the first then touch “higher” on the right side.
If the second tone is lower than the first then touch “lower” on the left side.

If you’re correct you’ll hear a high-pitch bell confirming.
If you’re wrong you’ll hear a low-pitch bell confirming.

If you can hear all of what has been described above then everything is working. Refresh the page to reset.

Now complete your regular sleep routine, e.g. brush your teeth, get into comfortable clothes, get under the covers.

Set the phone flat in bed somewhere comfortable near your right hand and place it horizontally, so your index finger matches the side marked
"lower" and your middle finger the side marked "higher".

Then you can click on the screen to start. 

The app has a runtime of 40 minutes.
At 20 minutes the experience will be half as loud and at 40 minutes the game should go silent.
